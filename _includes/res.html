      <h3><a href="/rs">Rayleigh scattering of the CMB.</a> </h3>
      Rayleigh scattering refers to the scattering of CMB photons by neutral species formed during recombination. Thanks to its correlation with the primary CMB, the Rayleigh scattering signal will help tightening constraints
      on LCDM parameters and its extensions.

      Component separation refers to the complex problem of isolating the signal of interest in a noisy mixture of signals with various astrophysical origins. The quality of the reconstructed map will directly impact
      scientists' ability to constrains cosmological models.
