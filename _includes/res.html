      <h3><a href = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11688'>Rayleigh scattering of the CMB.</a></h3>
      In the early Universe, the photons were kept in thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma through thomson scattering off free electrons.
      As the Universe exands and cools down, the free electrons end up recombining with the protons, allowinf the photons to decouple and free stream. However, recombination also yields neutral species, mainly Hydrogen and Helium by which CMB photons can also be scattered : this is <i>Rayleigh scattering</i>.
      In a series of three publications, we have studied the cosmological information contained in this small, frequency-dependent correction of the primary CMB as well as its detectability with the next generation of CMB surveys.

      <h3><a href = 'https://github.com/simonsobs/sps4lat'>Component separation for the Simons Observatory : sps4lat.</a></h3>
      Component separation refers to the complex problem of disentangling signals of interest in a noisy mixture. Observations of the CMB are spoiled by emissions with various astrophysical origins in the same frequency bands. Examples for such emissions include : dust and synchrotron radiations from our galaxy,
      extragalactic emissions arising from the large background of radio and infrared galaxies and clusters, etc ... Our ability to constrain cosmological parameters directly depends on how efficiently these <i>foregrounds</i> can be removed. With <b>sps4lat</b> we are implementing a flexible component separation method
      tailored to the specificities of ground-based observatories.
